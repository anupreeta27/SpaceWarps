Space Warps
-----------

Crowd-sourced discovery of gravitational lenses. We are a Zooniverse project, 
which launched in Spring 2013 at **[http://spacewarps.org](http://spacewarps.org)**. This repository contains code and documentation
being developed by the science team. The simulated lenses used in the training sample are created with [SIMCT](https://github.com/anupreeta27/SIMCT)


Training webpages are visible (but pretty old at this point) 
[here](http://drphilmarshall.github.com/SpaceWarps/).


The web app itself is being developed **[here](https://github.com/zooniverse/Lens-Zoo)** as part of the **[Zooniverse](http://zooniverse.org)** project. If you are interested in building a site like Space Warps using Zooniverse techology, keep an eye on their website or drop them a line.
